### Synopsis

Face is a language learning project and probably shouldn't be used in the real world. The goal is to practice using type parameters by writing a server-side webpage/component framework that's comfortable and intuitive and where the language of HTML is like a 'compile target', largely absent from the abstraction at hand. It will ideally provide under-the-hood automations such that the abstraction it offers is consistent, versatile and easy on mental resources.

### Direction

A Page's Body is an object of Classes, Attributes and a collection of Parts.

Parts can be Elements. Element Parts expose methods and properties that pertain to HTML elements, with interfaces to manipulate a class list, attributes, `data-` attributes and `List<T> where T: Part` content. A Page's header section is generated on render and manipulated via members such as `Title`. A Page's Body is of course an Element.

Parts can be components; essentially factories for producing Element structures depending on their own applicable properties. See [Face/Parts/*](Face/Parts/) for examples of components. See [Face/parts/TimeAgo.cs](Face/Parts/TimeAgo.cs) in particular for an example of client-side JavaScript involvement in components.

There are two ways to involve JavaScript. The simplest is to `JsUrls.Add(url)` inside your Page derivative's `Prepare()` override. This will include the script in the rendered `<head>` via `face.require()`.

Face adds another client-side scripting mechanism which I've found to be convenient and enjoyable. An *element script* can be registered with `face.register()`, then it'll be called against all elements whose `data-script` attribute matches the registered name. Registration will usually happen in a .js file loaded via `page.JsUrls`, itself usually having been automatically included due to the optional Part override `GetClientRequires()`. Client-side requirements are considered when writing a Part but not when consuming it. See [Face/parts/TimeAgo.cs](Face/Parts/TimeAgo.cs) and [Face.Parts.General.js](js/Face.Parts.General.js) for an example of this approach.

The element script system was designed to allow for asynchronous initialisation. Pass a `Promise` to `face.await()` in your custom JS file and we'll wait until your script's loaded and ready.

After dynamically adding content `face.apply()` should be called, optionally passing in the element containing the new content, to apply element scripts. `face.require()` may also be called freely to load dependencies of such content, or they could be preemptively added to the Page's `JsUrls`.

CSS links can likewise be added to a Page's head via `page.CssUrls`.

Reading an Element's ID will generate one if empty, so we can think of all Elements as simply 'having' a unique ID.

```c#  
InputElement input = new InputElement(){ Value = "wazzaaaa" };  
Console.WriteLine(input.RenderHtml());  
LabelElement label = new LabelElement(){ For = input }; // set => Attribs["for"] = value.Id  
Console.WriteLine(label.Attribs["for"]);  
Console.WriteLine(input.RenderHtml());  
// <input value="wazzaaaa">  
// 92a73ac38  
// <input value="wazzaaaa" id="92a73ac38">
```

Included is a similar system written in JavaScript. It was written for private use but I feel its similarity and ancestry to this project make it an ideal inclusion to give a degree of cognitive consistency between server and client code. For code and examples see [Face/js-src/jel/](Face/js-src/jel/).

### JSON

Face.Json provides an [`IJsonEncodable`](Face/Json/IJsonEncodable.cs) interface and an extension method `ToJson()` to produce JSON-formatted data from each of IJsonEncodable, string, int, double, bool, T[] and IDictionary<string, T> where T is any such type.

Rather than attempting to construct native objects from JSON data, `IJsonEncodable.ToJsValue()` and `JsValue.FromJson()` allow for manually-processed dynamic structure with runtime type-checking. Each produces a JsValue object with interfaces to read its internal value as any compatible type including `ReadOnlyDictionary<string, JsValue>` and `JsValue[]`. JS object properties can be read via `value[string]` and JS array entries can be read via `value[int]`. A JsValue reveals its type via `value.Type`, just as one might use `typeof` and `Array.isArray()` in JSON's most natural habitat.

I believe JSON's dynamically-structured nature is a strength and have aimed to take advantage of it while providing type information and safety where appropriate. See [demo/JsonDemo.cs](demo/JsonDemo.cs) for examples of importing and exporting JSON using this system.

Casting between JsValue and compatible types is implicit, though an implicit cast from JsValue will throw an exception if the internal type does not match the target type. Explicit casting (`jsv.StringValue`, `jsv.BooleanValue` etc) does not bear this restriction.

According to rough but generally consistent [benchmark](jsonbenchmark.log) ([JsonTest.cs](demo/JsonTest.cs)), `JsValue.FromJson()`'s performance is comparable with that of Utf8Json and Text.Json's equivalents in most cases and outperforms both in some common cases. I've tried to make [parse error messages](errortest.log) informative and concise.
